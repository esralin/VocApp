As it's mentioned in our research paper "Automatic Classification of English Words into CEFR Levels Based on Word Complexity Factors",
the words we classified into CEFR levels using the methods in the research study are utilized in the application's database.
You can switch to a smaller database of 100 words by changing the database file path in the WordDatabase class (line 22).
-> Replace "database/wordClassified.db" with "database/word.db"
