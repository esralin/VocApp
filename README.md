* VocApp is a vocabulary learning mechanism to demonstrate our work in a practical way, constructed as a mobile application, which provides a more personalized learning system by emphasizing the user's English vocabulary level based on their learning progress throughout the use of the application and a score calculation algorithm. In the questions, the definition of the word is given, and the user has to enter the corresponding word to correctly answer the question.



* As it's mentioned in our research paper "Automatic Classification of English Words into CEFR Levels Based on Word Complexity Factors",
the words we classified into CEFR levels using the methods in the research study are utilized in the application's database.
You can switch to a smaller database of 100 words by changing the database file path in the WordDatabase class (line 22).
-> Replace "database/wordClassified.db" with "database/word.db"
